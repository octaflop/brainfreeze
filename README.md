# BrainFreeze

*BrainFreeze* is just another quick-and-dirty blogging application that utilizes flask for templating and freezes to static pages with the possibility of future dynamic hosting â€” in particular, the expectation is to create an author view with in-page editing using jsonp or CORS.

## Installation
To keep JS and bootstrap CSS out of the repo, we use bower (you will need npm installed). Glyphicons support coming soon. Just copying the icons now. 

```bash
$ cd assets
$ npm install -g bower
$ bower install bootstrap
```

The symlinks should take care of the rest.
